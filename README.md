# Project Title: Smart City Simulation System

## Project Description:

Design a simulation system for a smart city that models transportation, communication, infrastructure, and public services. This simulation can manage dynamic data, simulate behaviors over time, and visualize interactions between entities like vehicles, people, and sensors.

## How Data Structures Are Used:

| Data Structure | Usage in Project
| Array / ArrayList | Store lists of static data like street names, buildings, or daily schedules.
| LinkedList | Model route itineraries or public transport stops dynamically.
| Stack | Implement undo/redo functionality in control panels (e.g., road layout edits).
| Queue / PriorityQueue | Simulate event queues or emergency call dispatch prioritized by severity.
| Deque | Represent double-ended vehicle queues at intersections or tunnels.
| HashMap / HashTable | Map sensor IDs to data values, user IDs to profiles, or locations to traffic stats.
| Tree (Binary Tree / AVL Tree / B+ Tree) | Index city locations or sorted logs of events efficiently.
| Heap | Schedule events with timers (e.g., traffic light timers, maintenance tasks).
| Set / HashSet / TreeSet | Track unique active devices, completed tasks, or banned areas.
| Graph (Adjacency List / Matrix) | Represent road networks, electricity grids, water systems.
| Trie | Implement efficient address or keyword auto-completion for a user interface.
| Disjoint Set (Union-Find) | Manage network connectivity (e.g., detecting isolated zones during outages).
| Custom Data Structures | Combine structures to build simulations like route planning or data dashboards.

## Bonus Features You Can Add:

- Real-time dashboard with sensor values and alerts.
- Pathfinding using A-star or Dijkstra (on your road network graph).
- Visual representation using JavaFX or Swing.
- File I/O for loading maps, logs, or configurations.
- Multithreading for simulating concurrent events (like simultaneous traffic flows).
